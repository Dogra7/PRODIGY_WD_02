Stopwatch Web Application

This repository contains a Stopwatch Web Application created as part of my Web Development Internship Task at Prodigy InfoTech. The stopwatch is designed to provide users with an interactive and user-friendly way to measure time intervals, track lap times, and reset the timer.

Features : -

Start/Pause Functionality: Start the stopwatch, pause it, and resume as needed.
Reset Timer: Reset the stopwatch to 00:00:00.
Lap Tracking: Record and display lap times with bullet points for clear tracking.
Circular Progress Bar: A dynamic circular progress bar that completes one full rotation after every 1 minute.
Responsive Design: Ensures the application is visually appealing and functional on various devices.

Technologies Used : -

HTML: For structuring the elements of the application.
CSS: For styling the application, including the circular progress bar and overall layout.
JavaScript: For implementing the stopwatch logic, including time tracking, lap recording, and updating the progress bar.
